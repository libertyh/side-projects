INSTRUCTIONS:

In the info tab, enter the number of total rows in your pattern and
the length of a pattern repeat (if desired).  When you flip back to 
the main panel, you can add rows by clicking on the "Add Row" button.
The display will show you the total number of rows you have knitted,
the number of the row in the repeat (so you know which portion of the
pattern you should be working on), and the current pattern repeat #.
The gauge will show you how close you are to finishing your project.

Enjoy!
